# python-env-bootstrap

A zero-dependency script skeleton for bootstrapping a developer's environment for an existing Python project.

Designed to work with Python 3.8 or later, it handles the bootstrapping of the tooling and modules environment for developing
in a project.

.. note:: It **DOES NOT** setup a new project

  It performs the setup of the *environment* for development of an existing project and is
  aimed at getting a working development environment quickly from a new checkout of a code
  repository.
